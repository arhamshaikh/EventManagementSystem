We would like to say thanks to our supervisor Miss Surraya for her time and effort she give us. Her
advice help us to complete our project.
In this system we want to display the all past and upcoming events to our audience.
**Project Overview:**
The Event Management System project will work and update the event records, participant records, all
expenditures during an event, student and teacher record. It will also keep the track record of particular
events and another events that have been carried out.
Event Management System project also keeps track of the number of participants in the event and their
registration accordingly. It is a remarkable system that can efficiently manage an event, store and
process necessary information related to event and uses this information for future events. It can be
further modified to execute for large or small events. Event Management System is largely being used
by event managers worldwide.

To organize and maintain events is a big task to do. To gather all the information in one place and to
engage users and to maintain that data is time consuming to overcome these problems we design the
event management system for our university where the system can store all the information related to
our past and upcoming events for user.
This system is also define the activities of the event and the venue where the event held. It also register
the user as participant, audience and guest for the upcoming events.
**Project Scope:**

number of companies/individuals organizing and hosting events has been growing rapidly. It varies from
large-scale international events to small time private events. A large team comprising of professionals is
